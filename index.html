		<p id="introduction">
				I am a cellular base station designer. For the last couple of years I've been working mostly as a middle manager than a designer and at some point I decided to make a career change to web development. I've been using programming for my personal needs for some time and I like to immerse fully in solving logical tasks, which I had a lack of as a manager. Another reason to choose programming was the necessity of continuous learning, which I believe would lead to the clarity of mind in old age. Working in the field of cellular base station designing and installation I often used to search for and promptly use in practice new different knowledges starting from occupational safety and health administration and ending with bearing capacity calculation, and this fast learning skill eventually taught me that there is nothing really difficult to learn in the world - you just need proper sequencing and enough time.

		<p>
			As I mentioned above I used programming for my private purposes.
			Basically I used JavaScript in conjunction with Google Sheets API and Telegram API.
			I have two active projects in use:
			<a href="https://github.com/Vadavur/SuperBabloBot">telegram bot scripts</a>
			for parsing our (my and my wife's) day expenses logs in telegram chat into categorized data
			in Google Sheets with several commands to form and view statistics
			- we use it for more than a year already - and
			<a href="https://github.com/Vadavur/SupplySheets">Google Apps Scripts</a> set
			in Google Sheets to optimize orders cost forming
			- my former coworker I transfered that part of my duties to still successfully uses it.
			Besides that I half made couple of projects I planed to use in business
			(so naive as it turned out therefor unfinished):
			simple construction company
			<a href="https://github.com/Vadavur/utgard">portfolio website</a> formed from downloaded
			and much reorganized template and Google Maps based construction machinery
			<a href="https://github.com/Vadavur/SpecTec">aggregator website</a>.

			<li><a href="http://610.ru/personae/?id=42">Saint-Petersburg classical gymnasium #610</a></li>

		</ul>
		
		<h4 class="headers"> English level </h4>

		<p>	
			My English level is upper-intermediate.
			I often use my English to read technical documentation, news and blogs, watch educational videos and, of course, programming memes. Though I have a lack of speaking so sometimes it takes time to recall some needed word while talking despite having no problems understanding the same word while reading.
